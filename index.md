This lesson shows how to use the
[Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) and
[Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) lesson template.
Each lesson is made up of *episodes* that are 10-30 minutes long
(including time for both teaching and exercises).
The episodes of this lesson explain the tools we use to create lessons
and the formatting rules those lessons must follow.

> ## Why "Episodes"?
>
> We call the parts of lessons "episodes" because
> every other term (like "topic") already has multiple meanings,
> and because it encourages us to think of breaking up our lessons
> into chunks that are about as long as a typical movie scene,
> which is better for learning than long blocks without interruption.

Every lesson's home page is contained in `index.md`,
and opens with a few pages.
After that come
a block stating prerequisites
and a line including `syllabus.html`
(which generates a summary of the lesson's episodes).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Use the `.prereq` style to specify prerequisites.
